# FAQ
- Why I need this? Why not `rails new`
Yeah, you could create new rails app, specify gemfile, create initializers, init and specify git and you a ready. Or you could just `gandy build my_awesome_rails_app -r 5` and get awesome bootstrap configuration.
- Why not use template?
Because they a ugly. You mix configuration with code in one massive file. Also you could use them only in initial phase.
- Can I update my existing project.
Currently - no. But this is one of the feature I implement in next release.

# Usage
To build default rails bootstrap app use:
`gandy build my_awesome_rails_app`
To help:
`gandy help build`
